> First things first: I’m a student at Data Science. Even knowing that I’ve followed all the specifications that I must and could manage to do, it can be some mistakes. Take this post seriously, but not that much.

## This comparsion begins at Kaggle.com, from where I got the “DataSet.csv” that I needed to begin.

## Using Google Colaboratory I made my very first solo data analysis, I’ve started by importing the libs that I would need to this chore.

Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

## And also imported the .csv that I’ve downloaded from Kaggle

## At this moment, I thought that the best way to split the information that I needed was by dividing it between multiple variables, like those:

## And after the 2319321 variables, I’ve reseted all the indexes to divide the columns to become an usable DataFrame (at least one that I could use, at my understanding):

## And did the same with the US information:

## I think that there is so many ways that I could do to make this code way more readable and faster, but at this moment, that is the way that I could manage to do, so I proceeded separating the expenditures by decades in charts like this one:

## And like it would be expected, did the same using the US data:

## After this stage, I was already liking the results, so I made a expenditure timeline from both countries, that goes from 1960 to 2018:

US Military Expenditure Timeline

Brazil’s Military Expenditure Timeline

## The code for both of the timelines was basically the same, I’ve just changed the variables and adapted the title and savefig:

## And at last but not less important, the comparsion:

## This graph explicits well the massive difference between the two nations investments, I was able to do that using those lines of code:

## And that’s it, the comparsion ends with this chart, but if that is any doubt left on your mind, you can go and check the notebook with those lines of codes by yourself, just click at the link below:
